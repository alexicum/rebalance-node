- Current balance
- Phone number input field (with mask and validation)
- The field for entering the amount of refill (with mask and validation, min possible amount - 1, max - 1000)

- heroku live app: https://rebalance-node.herokuapp.com

### Libs & conceptions
- cra - React project builder;
- github for hosting sources
- Continuous deployment: github > heroku
- node.js + express for static and REST API endpoints
- used functional setState: setState((state, props) => {});
- wrote stateUtils - functions helping in component state control of:
  - UI state (errors, touched controls),
  - fields values of the form.
- axios;
- [trashable-react](https://github.com/hjylewis/trashable-react):
  - request promise would be cancelled & nulled in componentWillUnmount and Component would be garbage collected.
- react-router (HashRouter)
- Components: `React.Semantic-UI` (contains ComboBox)

### TODO
- Move state, fetching and logic to HOC's (recompose) and to React Hooks in the future,
- Testing,
- BrowserRouter instead of HashRouter,
- redirect to / on full refresh on not home page,
- Use axios.cancel instead of trashable-react,
- css,
- refactoring of stateUtils.
